Changes between v1.3 and v1.4

DONE    LDR1, LDR2 are too close to D12

DONE    R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 are too close together

DONE    R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12 are too close together

DONE    R13, R14, R15 .. R23 are too close together

DONE    replace C1 with a electrolytic cap
            maybe 16v, 47uF, 100mil spacing
            improve spacing between C1 and C2

DONE    spec LEDs color, based on parts availability

DONE    generally improve silkscreen

DONE    correct the DIP-SWITCH Fritzing model, and replace
        silkscreen art somehow ended up in copper0 layer

DONE    make sure the resistors around the DIP-SWITCH have 1mm clearance

DONE    Rename CONN1/CONN2  to J-1, J-2

undone    Change J1, J2 to 2.0 pitch; JST-PH series.
            PHR-5 female housing  (digi key     455-1163-ND )
            B5B-PH-K-S(LF)(SN) , CONN HEADER PH TOP 5POS 2mm  (digi key 455-1707-ND )

NO      Draw cable drawing for PH cable

DONE    replace all 0805 resistors with 1206 resistors .. if they fit.
        (or not, depending on difficultly of soldering)

NO      replace U1/U2 74HC595D, with proper wide version of chip.  

DONE    decoupling CAP under U1 & U2

DONE    replace all 0805 LEDs with 1206 LEDs
